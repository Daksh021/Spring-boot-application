Hello viewers. This whole project is a very basic blog project which applies basic spring boot fundamentals like login,registeration,verification of user ultimately I have implemented spring security and implemented basic rest apis and association of 2 tables using foreign keys. This project is made inorder to implement all these concepts inorder to solidify the concepts of spring boot by applying them to make real life applications. I hope you will learn something :)
