Hello people! This project is a blog project which applies spring boot fundamentals like login, registeration, verification for users. Ultimately I have implemented spring security and implemented rest apis and associated 2 tables using foreign keys. This project is made inorder to implement all these concepts to solidify my own knowledge of spring boot by applying them to make a real life application.
Thank you!
